SSH Subsystem Test - Erlang

Just use make to compile everything, run the ./start_server.sh and then ./start_client.sh. 

A secure tunnel between the client and the server is set up (the private keys are already there - don't re-use them) and a message is sent from the Client and displayed in the Server Shell.
